/**
 * offline-audit — strict check that kneecap never talks to the network.
 *
 * kneecap is a fully offline, local-first fork of opencut-classic (see
 * docs/DECISIONS.md and plan §M0). Freesound, Google Fonts, Marble CMS,
 * better-auth/Postgres, Databuddy analytics, Vercel BotId, and a live
 * GitHub-API/brandfetch.io lookup were all removed or hard-disabled for
 * exactly this reason. This script is the regression gate that keeps them
 * gone: it scans source AND (when present) the built Next.js output for
 * outbound-network references — real `fetch`/XHR/WebSocket/script-src
 * calls to a host, not just any string containing "http" — and fails the
 * build if anything shows up that isn't on the tiny allowlist below.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/offline-audit.mjs [--skip-build-check]
 *   node scripts/offline-audit.mjs [--skip-build-check]
 *
 * Exit code 0  = clean.
 * Exit code 1  = violation(s) found — printed with file:line.
 * Exit code 2  = usage/environment problem (e.g. can't find the source tree).
 *
 * --skip-build-check lets this run before `bun run build` (e.g. as a fast
 * pre-commit check) without failing just because .next doesn't exist yet.
 * CI (`.github/workflows/bun-ci.yml`) always runs it *after* the build, so
 * the built client+server bundle gets scanned too.
