 * that reason — nothing here is a File, Blob, ArrayBuffer, or object URL.
 *
 * A DELIBERATE BOUNDARY, not an oversight: this file does NOT use editor-core
 * ticks (`meta.ticksPerSecond`, 120000-today). Ticks are an
 * `@kneecap/editor-core` / EDL-v1 concept — see docs/EDL.md §6, "durationTicks
 * on an asset is the one place the seconds→ticks boundary is crossed ... goes
 * through the WASM helper, never a bare multiply." A native media probe
 * (`AVAsset`, `MediaMetadataRetriever`) has no idea what an editor tick is and
 * must not invent one. So a probed `MediaHandle` reports `durationMicros` —
 * an INTEGER, never a float, in an unambiguous native-precision unit — and
 * editor-core is the only place that turns it into `durationTicks` via the
 * WASM helper. `exportProject`, by contrast, takes a fully-built `Edl`
 * (imported from `@kneecap/editor-core/edl`), which by then IS all ticks and
 * rationals — see plan §2.2's "Time values crossing the EDL bridge are
 * integer ticks + rational frame rates, never float seconds."
