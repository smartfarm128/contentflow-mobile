/**
 * Capacitor implementation of NativeBridge — plan §2.4 / M3, extended by
 * M4 (media custody) and M9 (export) on BOTH platforms.
 *
 * This is the ONE file (with its sibling `web-fallback.ts` and this
 * package's `types.ts`/`event-generator.ts`) allowed to import
 * `@capacitor/core`. Nothing else in the tree may — see
 * `scripts/invariants.sh`'s bridge-import gate and the
 * `no-restricted-imports` ESLint rule that mirrors it.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL: `capabilities()` (M3); `pickMedia()`, `generateProxy()`,
 * `generateThumbnails()` (M4); `exportProject()` (M9) — each calls a
 * genuinely registered native plugin method on BOTH
 * `apps/mobile/ios/App/App/NativeBridgePlugin{,+Media,+Export}.swift` and
 * `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/dev/kneecap/app/NativeBridgePlugin.kt`.
 * "Real" here means "correctly wired, and unit-tested against an injected
 * fake plugin" (`__tests__/capacitor-bridge.test.ts`) plus, per platform,
 * whatever the M4/M9 handoffs record as device/simulator-verified. It does
 * NOT by itself mean "verified end-to-end on device".
 *
 * WHAT IS STUBBED: `transcribe` (M10).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MERGE NOTE (track/ios + track/android unification, 2026-08-17)
 *
 * The two tracks independently grew this file and landed on two different
 * wire contracts for the same seam. This file is the unified one; the
 * native sides were brought to it, not the other way round:
 *
 *  1. EXPORT IDENTITY. iOS keyed `exportProject`/`exportCancel`/the
 *     `exportProgress` event stream by an `exportId`; Android had a single
 *     global export with a bare `cancelExport()`. Unified on the iOS shape
 *     (strictly more capable — it can route two concurrent exports, and a
 *     single-export native implementation can always just echo the id
 *     back). `NativeBridgePlugin.kt` was updated to accept `exportId`,
 *     stamp it onto every `exportProgress` payload, and expose
 *     `exportCancel({exportId})` in place of `cancelExport()`.
 *  2. THUMBNAILS. Android exposed a dedicated `generateThumbnails()`
 *     plugin method; iOS piggy-backed thumbnail paths onto
 *     `generateProxy`'s terminal `proxyProgress` event
 *     (`ProxyProgress.thumbnailUris`). BOTH survive, because they are
 *     genuinely different call shapes for different callers (M7's timeline
 *     asking for a filmstrip at a given density vs. import-time free
 *     output), and `generateThumbnails` was added to the iOS plugin so the
 *     method is real on both platforms rather than an Android-only trap.
 *  3. STRUCTURE. Android's plugin-injection parameter, typed error
 *     mapping (`toNativeBridgeError`) and defensive wire coercion
 *     (`fromWireMediaHandle`) are kept — they are strictly better than the
 *     iOS version's absence of them. iOS's shared, separately-unit-tested
 *     `subscribeToEvents` helper (`event-generator.ts`) is kept in place of
 *     Android's two hand-rolled, near-identical inline generators.
 *  4. URI CONVERSION. iOS's `toPlaybackUri` is kept and now applies to
 *     BOTH platforms' outputs (proxy, thumbnails, export) — Android's
 *     `Uri.fromFile(...)` `file://` paths are no more loadable by a
 *     WebView than iOS's raw sandbox paths are.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `transcribe` (M10) is a DIFFERENT kind of "not done" than the three above,
 * worth calling out explicitly rather than lumping it in: the JS<->native
 * call plumbing below, and the mandatory word-timestamp smoothing pass it
 * runs every result through (`./caption-smoothing.ts`), are REAL — verified
 * against a real whisper.cpp 1.9.2 DTW capture, see
 * `__tests__/caption-smoothing.test.ts` and `__tests__/fixtures/jfk-dtw-raw.ts`.
 * What is NOT yet real is the native half this calls INTO: iOS has no
 * `transcribe` method registered on `NativeBridgePlugin` (deliberately —
 * adding one that references whisper.cpp before `whisper.xcframework` is
 * actually embedded in the Xcode project would break the M3 CI build for
 * everyone); Android's `NativeBridgePlugin.transcribe()` exists and calls a
 * real JNI wrapper class shape (`WhisperJNI`, mirroring
 * `examples/whisper.android`), but has no bundled `.so` yet, so it throws
 * `UnsatisfiedLinkError` the moment it's actually invoked. Either way, a
 * call from here today still ends up in the same `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` catch
 * block below — but the moment either native half is wired for real, this
 * TS code starts working with NO further changes needed here.
