/**
 * kneecap M3 — Capacitor 8 shell config.
 *
 * appId/appName are the "original name" plan §8.2 requires (never CapCut-
 * adjacent). `webDir: "www"` is the LOCALLY BUNDLED static build the app
 * ships — plan M3 item 2: "No remote loading of the editor bundle: Apple
 * 2.5.2 forbids downloading code that changes app functionality." `www/` is
 * produced by `bun run build` (Vite) from `src/`; nothing in this config
 * points at a dev server or a remote URL.
 *
 * `server.hostname` matches plan M3 item 3's literal wording — "Android
 * System WebView via WebViewAssetLoader over
 * https://appassets.androidplatform.net so we get a proper secure-context
 * origin, not file://". Capacitor's own Android bridge already serves local
 * assets through androidx's WebViewAssetLoader by default (over
 * https://localhost, also a secure context, also not file://); this just
 * makes the hostname match the plan's cited value exactly rather than rely
 * on Capacitor's default being "close enough."
 *
 * iOS needs no equivalent override: Capacitor's WKWebView integration
 * already satisfies Apple 2.5.6 (WKWebView, not the deprecated UIWebView) and
 * already avoids file:// by construction — there is no bundled iOS analogue
 * to appassets.androidplatform.net to opt into.
